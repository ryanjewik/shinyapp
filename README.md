The goal of this model is to create the best possible predictive model for housing prices. After pre-processing, data retrieval, and feature engineering, we created a linear regression model and a gradient boosting tree. The results were measured using R2, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and other valuation metrics to determine their accuracy.

the data files will need to be stored in a folder named "data" within the "content" folder in google collab. Afterwards the file can be ran just by running all cells
